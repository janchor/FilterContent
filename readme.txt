FilterContent is intended to provide a way to blank out objectional content such as curse words, sex, or violence.
It aims to provide the user an interface to customize what content to filter, based on a text-based markup file for each movie.

Roadmap:
- cannabilze "Intro and credits Skipper" addon as a code base that allows custom skipping of scenes
- mute audio feature
- read in markup files
- distinguish between various possible offensive content
- approximate where to mute based on subtitles
